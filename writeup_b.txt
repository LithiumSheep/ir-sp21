In classifying lines and segments of text, several challenges are apparent.  However, some simple 
features were able to classify a decent amount of lines and segments.

Simple features matching the classifiers described in 'standards' such as checking for the '>' character 
and if a line starts with the '>' character for the QUOTED classifier seemed to work minus the introductory lines.

Checking for the presence of the ':' character found many of the NNHEAD lines. Counting capitalized words worked 
very well for finding HEADL lines.  Checking for numeric words was average at detecting ITEM or TABLE lines. 

Finally, a set of features around detecting common punctuations such as '.', ',', and the tab character were identified
to try and find PTEXT and to try to distinguish ITEM lines.  This was not very successful.   

Overall on the test data, these features were able to classify lines and segments at around 90% accuracy.  It's very likely 
that the simple features provided caused some level of over-fitting of the model.  Finding combinations of features may 
improve the accuracy of the model.
