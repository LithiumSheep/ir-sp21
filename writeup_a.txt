In classifying EOS or NEOS, the biggest gains from the baseline of 0.897 was 
the realization that the provided word lists were all lower-case, and so checking
using statements like 

```
1 if word_m1.lower() in self.abbrevs else 0
```

produced the greatest increase in accuracy.  

For word lists "abbrevs", "titles", "sentence_internal", and "timeterms", checking
if `word_m1` existed in them tended to indicate that the period was NEOS
